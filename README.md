Snake Game – Python Mini Project
Project Overview
This project is a classic Snake Game developed using Python’s built-in turtle module. It demonstrates essential programming skills including user input handling, loops, conditionals, and basic gameplay logic in Python.

Features
Keyboard controls (W, A, S, D) for snake movement

Random placement of food for the snake

Score and high score tracking

Collision detection with walls and the snake’s own body

Installation
Requirements:

Python 3.x

No third-party modules needed

Setup:

Save the snake_game.py file in your working folder

How to Run:

text
python snake_game.py
How to Play
Use W (up), A (left), S (down), D (right) to control the snake.

Eat food to grow longer and increase your score.

Avoid walls and colliding with your own body.

Learning Outcomes
Practiced Python basics: loops, conditionals, and input handling

Implemented simple game algorithms and logic

Developed a fun, interactive programming project

Possible Improvements
Add sound or graphics enhancements

Save high scores

Add more features like obstacles or levels
